plsMD: A plasmid reconstruction tool for short-read assemblies
-----
Introduction
------------
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has become a cornerstone of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance. However, reconstructing plasmid sequences from short-read WGS data is challenging due to repetitive sequences and assembly fragmentation. 
plsMD is a tool designed for comprehensive plasmid reconstruction from short-read assemblies, going beyond simple contig binning. It utilizes Unicycler assemblies with established plasmid databases to reconstruct full plasmid sequences, plsMD offers both single and multi-sample analysis, enabling researchers to perform detailed plasmid characterization and phylogenetic investigations.

-----------
--------
Preprocessing and Annotation
------
```bash
plsmd --preprocessing --dir <input_directory> --threads <num_threads> --db <plsdb_path>
```
| Option | Description | 
|---|---|
| `--dir` | Input directory containing unicylcer assembly FASTAs | 
| `--threads` | Number of threads | 
| `--db` | PLSDB database path | 
------
Processing and reconstruction
----
```bash
plsMD --process --dir <input_directory>
```
| Option | Description | 
|---|---|
| `--dir` | Input directory containing the preprocessed data (output from plsMD --preprocessing) | 
-------
plsMD batch modality
------
In addition to the preprocessing and processing scripts, run plsMD_phylogenetics for batch samples modality.

------
Phylogenetic Analysis
------
```bash
plsmd --phylogenetics --genes_dir <genes_directory> --min_length <min_length> --max_length <max_length> --threads <threads>
```
| Option | Description | 
|---|---|
| `--genes_dir` |Root directory containing gene folders. Each subdirectory should represent a gene family and contain the corresponding sequences | 
| `--threads` | Number of threads | 
| `--min_length` | Minimum sequence length for common sequence search. |
| `--min_length` | Maximum sequence length for common sequence search. |
